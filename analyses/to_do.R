### To DO: 
# 1. Check if old stimuli in test phase are correct!!! 
# 2. Include if key is none, then response = "NA", 
# 3. change respone = "0" to response = str(cat_order[0])if key == 275: response = str(cat_order[1]) in test phases
# 4. Change in row 536 numpy.array(range(10))!!!

# 1. Change time pressure method
# 2. Look for alternative multiple testing correction methods that are less conservative than Bonferroni

#### Feedback Jörg
# 1. Analyze reaction times
# 2. Integrate idea of random choice
# 3. present descriptive results (figure) first before making inferential tests
